## 👨🏻‍💻 A Little Bit of Me!

Hi there! I'm **Alireza Nowruzi** from Tehran 📍 — a full-time coder, part-time bug whisperer, and caffeine-fueled software enthusiast.

I've been writing code professionally since **2017**, but the obsession began in **2015**. For the last few years, I’ve been deep into **R&D in IoT and Data Mining**, trying to make things smarter (and cooler) one project at a time.
