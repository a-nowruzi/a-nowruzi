# 👨🏻‍💻 A Little Bit of Me!

Hi there! I'm **Alireza Nowruzi** from Tehran 📍 — a full-time coder, part-time bug whisperer, and caffeine-fueled software enthusiast.

I've been writing code professionally since **2017**, but the obsession began in **2015**. For the last few years, I’ve been deep into **R&D in IoT and Data Mining**, trying to make things smarter (and cooler) one project at a time.

### 🧠 My Toolkit Includes:
- ⚛️ React — Building snappy, scalable UIs
- 🧩 C# — Crafting solid backend logic
- 📱 Flutter — Cross-platform apps that don’t just work, but *wow*

# 🔍 What I'm Into
- 🎓 Teaching cool dev stuff to cool people  
- 🤝 Freelancing and collaborating on **open-source** projects  
- 🧪 Experimenting with new ideas that might just work  
- 💬 Talking about all of the above with anyone who’s interested
